# LoconomicFulcrum
Loconomic Fulcrum allows local small businesses (such as farms) to list produce they grow, and also easily hire people for jobs such as the delivery of their products to the consumer. The unemployed (or even volunteers) can list their hours of work. Then, small businesses can look and select who they would like to higher for a certain job.
